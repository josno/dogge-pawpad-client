# PawPad

PawPad helps dog-shelter runners keep track of essential information for each dog. It allows users stay on top of each dog's record to ensure dogs are happy and healthy.

## Demo [Here](https://www.usepawpad.com/)

## See API Repo [Here](https://github.com/josno/pawpad-server)

## How Do I Use This?

- Create an account and log in
- See a list of dogs and click on their pictures for additional information
- You can do the following:

  - Add a new dog
  - Edit dog information
  - See/write/submit notes for each dog
  - Update/delete shot information
  - Set adoption information
  - Delete dog
  - Archive dog

## How is this helpful?

I made this open-source platform as a result of a conversation with a colleague who volunteers with a small, local dog shelter. She was upset because she almost gave a young puppy a repeat vaccination that may have caused the puppy to develop allergies. Medical notes are written on paper files that were mixed up so she didn't have the proper background information for that puppy. Smaller shelters cannot afford to purchase specific software to cover this gap.

This is a **_supplemental and intermediary solution_** to help keep records updated.
